# Changes from 0.38.x to 1.0

`rustix::pipe::fcntl_getpipe_size` now returns the new size, which may be
greater than the requested size.

`rustix::thread::FutexOperation` and `rustix::thread::futex` are removed. Use
the functions in the `rustix::thread::futex` module instead.

`rustix::process::waitpid`'s return type changed from `WaitStatus` to
`(Pid, WaitStatus)`, to additionally return the pid of the child.

The "cc" and "libc-extra-traits" features are removed. The "cc" feature hasn't
had any effect for several major releases. If you need the traits provided
by "libc-extra-traits", you should instead depend on libc directly and enable
its "extra_traits" feature.

All explicitly deprecated functions and types have been removed. Their
deprecation messages will have identified alternatives.
